<p>OpenTrading Mt4 Library Code<br />
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Lib">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Lib</a></p>

<p>The OTMql4Lib aims to provide a high-quality library of code to Mt4<br />
with testing and documentation, that can serve as a basis to other projects.</p>

<p>Metatrader has been a great international success, putting into the<br />
hands of end-users the ability to do programmed trading, something<br />
that was only previously available to large trading houses. It has<br />
been widely adopted, provides a credible platform for Forex trading,<br />
and there are a huge number of "experts" and programs that have been<br />
developed for it.</p>

<p>However, Metatrader as a language is not without some significant<br />
drawbacks. The language is very rudimentary from the computer science<br />
point of view, and is a closed sole-source product. Very importantly<br />
for writing robust, well-tested and easily maintained code, it lacks<br />
proper error handling flow-of-control constructs, such as are found in<br />
Java, Python or Lisp. This leads to poor quality code, as can be seen<br />
by much of the MQL code in existence, including the code from the<br />
manufacturer, MetaQuotes. The poor nature of the language combines<br />
with the very poor coding practices of the community (e.g. not<br />
checking error codes and no documentation or testing) to create a very<br />
poor programming environment.</p>

<p><strong>This is a work in progress - a developers' version.</strong></p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>For the moment there is no installer: just "git clone" or download the<br />
zip from github.com and unzip into an empty directory. Then recursively copy<br />
the folder MQL4 over the MQL4 folder of your Metatrader installation. It will<br />
not overwrite any system files, and keeps its files in subdirectories<br />
called <tt>OTMql4</tt>.</p>
