<p>Welcome to the OTMql4Lib project!</p>

<p>The OTMql4Lib aims to provide a high-quality library of code to Metatrader 4,<br />
with testing and documentation, that can serve as a basis to other projects.<br />
It is the common library of Mt4 code to all of the OpenTrading projects:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/">https://github.com/OpenTrading/</a> and is required as a prerequisite by OpenTrader<br />
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader</a></p>

<p>One of the key funtionalities that it provides is the <tt>ProcessCmd</tt> functions<br />
which is a simple replacement for what should be an <tt>Eval</tt> command in Mt4,<br />
to allow an Expert to evaluate arbirtary Mt4 commands. This can be used by<br />
any Remote Procedure Call libraries to send commands to Mt4 for evaluation.</p>
