<h3>Binary Installer</h3>

<p>There is now an installer in the Releases section on github:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Lib/releases">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Lib/releases</a><br />
It's a simple installer that asks where you want the software installed,<br />
and the location of your <img src="{AppData" title="{AppData" alt="{AppData" /> Metatrader terminal directory,<br />
and copies the files to the right places; it installs a copy of the<br />
documentation too.  Usually you could just overwrite old releases with<br />
new ones, but for now we recommend unistalling old releases before<br />
installing new ones in case the filenames have changed.</p>

<p>The location of your Metatrader directory to install into is no longer the<br />
<tt>Program Files}} directory (something like {{{c:/Program Files/MetaTrader 4 Terminal/</tt>)<br />
but rather your personal <tt>AppData</tt> directory (something like<br />
<tt>c:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\MetaQuotes\Terminal\LONGHEXNANE</tt>).<br />
When Setup asks you to select your existing Metatrader 4 folder in which Setup<br />
should install MQL4 files, use the Browse button to select it, then click Next.</p>

<h3>Install from Source</h3>

<p>Alernatively, you can just "git clone" or download the zip from github.com<br />
and unzip into an empty directory. Then recursively copy the folder<br />
<tt>MQL4</tt> over the <tt>MQL4</tt> folder of your personal <tt>AppData...</tt> directory<br />
(something like<br />
<tt>c:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\MetaQuotes\Terminal\LONGHEXNANE</tt>).<br />
It will not overwrite any system files, and keeps its files in subdirectories<br />
called <tt>OTMql4</tt>.</p></body>
