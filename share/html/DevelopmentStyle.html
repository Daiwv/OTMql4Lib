<h3>Coding Style</h3>

<p>Metatrader has been a great international success, putting into the<br />
hands of end-users the ability to do programmed trading, something<br />
that was only previously available to large trading houses. It has<br />
been widely adopted, provides a credible platform for Forex trading,<br />
and there are a huge number of "experts" and programs that have been<br />
developed for it.</p>

<p>However, Metatrader as a language is not without some significant<br />
drawbacks. The language is very rudimentary from the computer science<br />
point of view, and is a closed sole-source product. Very importantly<br />
for writing robust, well-tested and easily maintained code, it lacks<br />
proper error handling flow-of-control constructs, such as are found in<br />
Java, Python or Lisp. This leads to poor quality code, as can be seen<br />
by much of the MQL code in existence, including the code from the<br />
manufacturer, MetaQuotes. The poor nature of the language combines<br />
with the very poor coding practices of the community (e.g. not<br />
checking error codes and no documentation or testing) to create a very<br />
poor programming environment.</p>

<h4>Type Prefixing</h4>

<p>We prefix all variable, function and method names with a lowercase letter<br />
that indicates the type; it helps you anticipate what type a quantity<br />
is, and to make explicit type conversions. This is not a rigid requirement,<br />
but it helps cut down on a very common type of mistake, pun intended.</p>

<p>If the type changes, give it a new name with the initial letter changed.<br />
In Mql, this scheme has the added advantage of avoiding any naming<br />
conflict with Mql built-ins, or most Python standard library modules.</p>

<p>Choose the initial letter from the following list:</p>

<table>

	<td>a</td>

	<td>v</td>
	<td>void - return value not to be used</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>z</td>
	<td>non-empty string return - empty is a failure</td>
</tr>
